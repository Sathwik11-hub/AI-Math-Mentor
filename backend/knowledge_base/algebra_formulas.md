# Algebra Formulas and Concepts

## Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation is in the form: ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0

### Quadratic Formula
The solutions are given by:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

### Discriminant
D = b² - 4ac
- If D > 0: Two distinct real roots
- If D = 0: One repeated real root
- If D < 0: Two complex conjugate roots

### Factoring Method
For x² + (a+b)x + ab = 0
Solutions: x = -a or x = -b
Example: x² + 5x + 6 = 0 → (x+2)(x+3) = 0 → x = -2 or x = -3

## Linear Equations
Form: ax + b = 0, where a ≠ 0
Solution: x = -b/a

### System of Linear Equations
Two equations with two variables:
a₁x + b₁y = c₁
a₂x + b₂y = c₂

Methods:
1. Substitution
2. Elimination
3. Matrix method

## Inequalities
### Rules:
- Adding/subtracting same number preserves inequality
- Multiplying/dividing by positive number preserves inequality
- Multiplying/dividing by negative number reverses inequality
- If a > b and c > d, then a + c > b + d

### Common Mistakes:
- Forgetting to reverse inequality sign when multiplying by negative
- Not considering equality case in ≤ or ≥
- Incorrect interval notation

## Polynomials
### Remainder Theorem
When polynomial P(x) is divided by (x - a), remainder is P(a)

### Factor Theorem
(x - a) is a factor of P(x) if and only if P(a) = 0

### Binomial Theorem
(a + b)ⁿ = Σ(k=0 to n) C(n,k) · aⁿ⁻ᵏ · bᵏ
where C(n,k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!)
