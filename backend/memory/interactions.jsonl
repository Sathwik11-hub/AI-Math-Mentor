Let's break down how to solve this quadratic equation, `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0`. Don't worry, it's a fundamental skill you'll master in no time!\n\n**Understanding the Goal:**\nOur main goal is to find the values of 'x' that make this equation true. These values are called the 'roots' or 'solutions' of the equation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given quadratic equation.**\n\n*   **WHY this step?** The very first thing we do in any math problem is to clearly understand what we're dealing with. Here, we're given `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0`. This is a quadratic equation because the highest power of 'x' is 2. Recognizing the type of equation helps us choose the right tools to solve it.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the coefficients (a, b, c) of the standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.**\n\n*   **WHY this step?** Every quadratic equation can be written in the standard form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. Identifying 'a', 'b', and 'c' is crucial because these coefficients are the building blocks for solving the equation, whether you use factoring, the quadratic formula, or even a computational tool. For our equation `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0`:\n    *   `a` is the coefficient of `x^2`, so `a = 1` (since `1x^2` is just `x^2`).\n    *   `b` is the coefficient of `x`, so `b = 5`.\n    *   `c` is the constant term, so `c = 6`.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: How a computer solves it vs. How YOU solve it!**\n\n*   The provided solution mentions using a `SymPy`'s 'solve' function. This is a powerful tool in programming that can quickly find the roots for you. It essentially applies mathematical algorithms (like the ones we're about to discuss!) very fast.\n\n*   **WHY do *we* need to learn manual methods then?** Because understanding the underlying math is key for JEE! In exams, you won't have SymPy, so let's see how you'd solve this manually. There are a few common ways to solve quadratic equations, and for this particular one, **factoring** is super efficient!\n\n    **Method 1: Factoring the Quadratic Equation (The Easiest Way for This Problem!)**\n\n    *   **WHY this method?** Factoring works beautifully when you can find two numbers that multiply to 'c' and add up to 'b'. It simplifies the equation into a product of two linear factors, making it easy to find 'x'.\n    *   **Let's do it:** We need two numbers that:\n        1.  Multiply to `c = 6`\n        2.  Add up to `b = 5`\n    *   Think about pairs of factors for 6: (1, 6), (2, 3), (-1, -6), (-2, -3).\n    *   Which pair adds up to 5? Bingo! `2 + 3 = 5`.\n    *   So, we can rewrite the middle term (`5x`) as `2x + 3x`:\n        `x^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 = 0`\n    *   Now, group the terms and factor by grouping:\n        `x(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = 0`\n    *   Notice that `(x + 2)` is common. Factor it out:\n        `(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0`\n    *   **WHY this helps?** This is where the **Zero Product Property** comes in handy! It states that if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. So, either `(x + 2) = 0` or `(x + 3) = 0`.\n    *   Solving these two simple linear equations:\n        *   `x + 2 = 0`  =>  `x = -2`\n        *   `x + 3 = 0`  =>  `x = -3`\n\n    **Method 2: Using the Quadratic Formula (The Universal Method!)**\n\n    *   **WHY this method?** The quadratic formula always works, even when factoring is difficult or impossible. It's your reliable backup for any quadratic equation!\n    *   The formula is: `x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a`\n    *   Let's plug in our values `a = 1`, `b = 5`, `c = 6`:\n        `x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(5^2 - 4 * 1 * 6)] / (2 * 1)`\n        `x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 - 24)] / 2`\n        `x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(1)] / 2`\n        `x = [-5 \u00b1 1] / 2`\n    *   Now, calculate the two possible values for x:\n        *   `x1 = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2`\n        *   `x2 = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3`\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBoth methods lead us to the same solutions: `x = -3` or `x = -2`. This matches what the `SymPy` function would return!\n\nGreat job understanding the different ways to tackle quadratic equations!", "key_concepts": ["Quadratic Equation", "Standard Form of Quadratic Equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0)", "Coefficients (a, b, c)", "Roots/Solutions of an Equation", "Factoring Quadratic Equations", "Zero Product Property", "Quadratic Formula", "Discriminant (b^2 - 4ac)"], "common_mistakes": ["**Sign Errors:** Be very careful with positive and negative signs, especially when using the quadratic formula or factoring.

Setting each factor to zero gives:\n    *   x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2\n    *   x + 3 = 0  =>  x = -3\n\n2.  **Quadratic Formula**: Using the formula x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a):\n    *   Substitute a=1, b=5, c=6:\n        x = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(5\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * 6)) / (2 * 1)\n        x = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 - 24)) / 2\n        x = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a1) / 2\n        x = (-5 \u00b1 1) / 2\n    *   This yields two solutions:\n        x1 = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2\n        x2 = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3\n\n3.  **SymPy (Symbolic Python) Method**: As per the strategy, SymPy's `solve()` function can directly compute the roots. We define 'x' as a symbolic variable and pass the equation to the `solve()` function.\n    The SymPy code `from sympy import symbols, solve; x = symbols('x'); equation = x**2 + 5*x + 6; solutions = solve(equation, x)` will return `[-3, -2]`.\n\nAll methods consistently yield the solutions x = -2 and x = -3.

Let's break down how to solve this quadratic equation step-by-step. Don't worry, we'll make sure you understand the 'why' behind everything!\n\n**Problem:** Solve x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given quadratic equation and its coefficients.**\n*   **What we're doing:** First things first, we recognize that x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 is a quadratic equation. A standard quadratic equation always looks like ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants, and 'a' is not zero.\n*   **Why we do this:** Identifying 'a', 'b', and 'c' is super important because these values are used in almost every method to solve quadratic equations, whether it's factoring or using the quadratic formula. It helps us organize our thoughts and prepare for the next steps.\n*   **In our case:** By comparing x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 with ax^2 + bx + c = 0, we can clearly see:\n    *   a = 1 (the coefficient of x^2)\n    *   b = 5 (the coefficient of x)\n    *   c = 6 (the constant term)\n\n**Step 2: Apply the factoring method to find the roots of the equation.**\n*   **What we're doing:** Factoring is often the quickest way to solve a quadratic equation if it's factorable. Our goal is to rewrite the quadratic expression as a product of two simpler linear expressions (like (x+p)(x+q)).\n*   **Why we do this:** If we can express the quadratic as a product of two factors, say (x + p)(x + q) = 0, then by the **Zero Product Property**, at least one of these factors must be zero. This means either (x + p) = 0 or (x + q) = 0, which directly gives us the values of x (the roots).\n*   **How to factor (for x^2 + bx + c = 0):** We need to find two numbers that, when multiplied, give us 'c' (which is 6) and when added, give us 'b' (which is 5).\n*   **Let's find those numbers:** After a little thought, we find that 2 and 3 fit the bill perfectly! (Because 2 * 3 = 6 and 2 + 3 = 5).\n*   **Now, let's factor the equation:**\n    x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\n    x^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 = 0  (We 'split the middle term', 5x, into 2x + 3x using our found numbers)\n    x(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = 0 (Factor out common terms: 'x' from the first two terms and '3' from the last two terms)\n    (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0      (Notice that (x + 2) is a common factor, so we factor it out)\n*   **Apply the Zero Product Property:**\n    Since (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0, we have two possibilities:\n    1.  x + 2 = 0  =>  x = -2\n    2.  x + 3 = 0  =>  x = -3\n*   **So, our roots (solutions) are x = -2 and x = -3.**\n\n**Step 3: Verify the solution using the quadratic formula.**\n*   **What we're doing:** The **Quadratic Formula** is a powerful tool that *always* works for any quadratic equation, even if it's not easily factorable. It's a fantastic way to double-check our factoring results and ensure we haven't made any mistakes.\n*   **Why we do this:** Verification is a crucial step in problem-solving. It builds confidence in your answer and helps catch potential calculation errors. If both methods give the same answer, you're super confident in your solution!\n*   **The Quadratic Formula:** x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n*   **Substitute our values (a=1, b=5, c=6) carefully:**\n    x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(5^2 - 4 * 1 * 6)] / (2 * 1)\n    x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 - 24)] / 2\n    x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(1)] / 2\n    x = [-5 \u00b1 1] / 2\n*   **Calculate the two possible roots (one for '+' and one for '-'):**\n    For the '+' sign: x = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2\n    For the '-' sign: x = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3\n*   **Excellent! The roots are x = -2 and x = -3, perfectly matching our factoring method!** This gives us great confidence in our answer.\n\n**Step 4: Use SymPy's 'solve' function to confirm the roots.**\n*   **What we're doing:** This step involves using a computational tool, SymPy (a Python library for symbolic mathematics), to quickly solve the equation. Think of it as having a super-smart algebraic calculator!\n*   **Why we do this:** While you won't use SymPy in a typical pen-and-paper exam, understanding that such tools exist and can be used for verification in real-world scenarios or for checking homework is incredibly valuable.

Don't worry, it's like following a recipe, and with practice, you'll master it!\n\n**Step 1: Identify the coefficients (a, b, c)**\n\n*   **What we do:** We look at our equation, `x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0`, and compare it to the standard form of a quadratic equation, which is `ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0`.\n*   **Why we do it:** This is our very first and super important step! The quadratic formula (which we'll use later) relies entirely on these 'a', 'b', and 'c' values. Think of it as gathering all your ingredients before you start cooking. Here, we see that `a = 1` (because it's `1x\u00b2`), `b = 5`, and `c = 6`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant (D)**\n\n*   **What we do:** We use a special formula: `D = b\u00b2 - 4ac`. Plugging in our values: `D = (5)\u00b2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1`.\n*   **Why we do it:** The discriminant is like a fortune teller for our roots! It tells us *what kind* of solutions we're going to get *before* we even find them. It's a powerful tool that saves time and helps us anticipate the nature of our answers. \n\n**Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots**\n\n*   **What we do:** We look at the value of D. Since `D = 1`, which is greater than 0 (`D > 0`), we know that there will be two distinct (different) real roots.\n*   **Why we do it:** This step connects the discriminant's value to the properties of the roots. If `D` were 0, we'd have two equal real roots. If `D` were negative, we'd have no real roots (only complex/imaginary ones). Knowing this helps us confirm if our eventual answers make sense and if we're on the right track, especially if the problem asks for only real solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Quadratic Formula**\n\n*   **What we do:** Now that we know we have real roots, we use the famous quadratic formula: `x = (-b \u00b1 \u221aD) / (2a)`. Let's substitute our values: `x = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a1) / (2 * 1) = (-5 \u00b1 1) / 2`.\n*   **Why we do it:** This is the universal tool for finding the actual values of 'x' that satisfy a quadratic equation. It works every single time, no matter how complex the equation might seem. The `\u00b1` sign is super important here, as it indicates we'll get two possible solutions.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the two distinct roots**\n\n*   **What we do:** We split the formula into two cases, one for the `+` sign and one for the `-` sign:\n    *   For `+`: `x\u2081 = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2`\n    *   For `-`: `x\u2082 = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3`\n*   **Why we do it:** A quadratic equation (with `x\u00b2`) typically has two solutions. The `\u00b1` in the quadratic formula is precisely there to give us these two distinct values. This step is about performing the final arithmetic carefully to get our answers.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the solution (Optional but Recommended!)**\n\n*   **What we do:** The solution mentions using SymPy, a powerful Python library, to confirm the roots. You can also manually check by plugging each root back into the original equation `x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0`.\n    *   For `x = -2`: `(-2)\u00b2 + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0`. (It works!)\n    *   For `x = -3`: `(-3)\u00b2 + 5(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0`. (It works!)\n*   **Why we do it:** This step is like double-checking your work before submitting an exam. It gives you confidence that your calculated roots are correct and truly satisfy the original equation. It's a great habit to develop for all math problems!\n\nAnd there you have it!

Let's break down how to solve this quadratic equation step-by-step. Don't just follow along, try to understand the 'why' behind each move \u2013 that's what truly helps you learn!\n\n**Step 1: Identify the given quadratic equation.**\nOur equation is `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0`. The very first thing we do is recognize its type. This equation fits the standard form of a quadratic equation: `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. By comparing, we can see that `a=1`, `b=5`, and `c=6`. \n*   **Why this step?** Identifying the type of equation is crucial because it tells us which methods we can use to solve it. Knowing it's a quadratic equation immediately brings to mind techniques like factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square.\n\n**Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression.**\nNow, we aim to 'break down' the `x^2 + 5x + 6` part into a product of two simpler expressions (binomials). For a quadratic in the form `x^2 + bx + c = 0` (where `a=1`), we need to find two numbers that:\n1.  Multiply to `c` (which is 6 in our case).\n2.  Add up to `b` (which is 5 in our case).\nLet's think: What two numbers multiply to 6? (1,6), (2,3), (-1,-6), (-2,-3). Now, which of these pairs adds up to 5? Ah, it's 2 and 3! (`2 * 3 = 6` and `2 + 3 = 5`).\n*   **Why this step?** Factoring is often the quickest and most elegant way to solve quadratic equations, especially when the roots are integers. It transforms the problem into a form where we can easily apply the Zero Product Property (which we'll see in Step 4).\n\n**Step 3: Rewrite the equation using the factors.**\nSince we found the numbers 2 and 3, we can rewrite our quadratic expression as `(x + 2)(x + 3)`. So, our equation becomes `(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0`.\n*   **Why this step?** This is simply showing the result of our factoring process. It sets the stage perfectly for the next step, which is the core idea behind solving by factoring.\n\n**Step 4: Set each factor equal to zero to find the roots.**\nThis is where a super important concept comes in: the **Zero Product Property**. It states that if the product of two or more factors is zero, then at least one of those factors *must* be zero. In our case, we have `(x + 2) * (x + 3) = 0`. This means either `(x + 2)` must be zero OR `(x + 3)` must be zero (or both!).\n*   **Why this step?** This property allows us to take a more complex quadratic equation and break it down into two much simpler linear equations. It's the 'magic' that lets us find the individual values of x.\n\n**Step 5: Solve for x in each case.**\nNow we just solve the two simple linear equations we got from Step 4:\n1.  From `x + 2 = 0`, if we subtract 2 from both sides, we get `x = -2`.\n2.  From `x + 3 = 0`, if we subtract 3 from both sides, we get `x = -3`.\n*   **Why this step?** We're simply isolating 'x' in each linear equation to find its specific value. This gives us our potential solutions.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the solutions using SymPy's 'solve' function.**\n(This step is more for confirmation in a computational environment, but it highlights a crucial practice!)\nIn a real exam, you'd verify your solutions by plugging them back into the *original* equation. Let's quickly check one:\nIf `x = -2`: `(-2)^2 + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0`. Correct!\nIf `x = -3`: `(-3)^2 + 5(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0`. Correct!\n*   **Why this step?** Verification is a fantastic habit! It helps you catch any calculation errors and builds confidence in your answers. Always try to quickly plug your solutions back into the original equation to ensure they work.\n\n**Step 7: State the final solutions.**\nPutting it all together, the values of x that satisfy the equation `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0` are `x = -2` and `x = -3`.\n*   **Why this step?** Clearly presenting your final answer is important.

Let's break down this probability problem step-by-step. We'll start with the basics of rolling dice and then move on to repeated trials using a powerful tool called the Binomial Distribution.\n\n### Part 1: Probability of getting a sum of 5 with one pair of fair dice\n\n**Step 1.1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes.**\nImagine you have two distinct dice (maybe one red, one blue). When you roll the first die, there are 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). For *each* of these outcomes, the second die also has 6 possible outcomes. So, to find the total number of unique combinations, we multiply the possibilities for each die: 6 * 6 = 36. This set of all possible outcomes is called our **sample space**. Think of it as all the unique pairs you can get, like (1,1), (1,2), ..., (6,6).\n\n**Step 1.2: Identify the favorable outcomes where the sum is 5.**\nNow, we need to find which of these 36 pairs add up to 5. Let's list them systematically to make sure we don't miss any:\n*   If the first die is 1, the second must be 4 (1 + 4 = 5). So, (1, 4).\n*   If the first die is 2, the second must be 3 (2 + 3 = 5). So, (2, 3).\n*   If the first die is 3, the second must be 2 (3 + 2 = 5). So, (3, 2).\n*   If the first die is 4, the second must be 1 (4 + 1 = 5). So, (4, 1).\n*   If the first die is 5 or 6, you can't get a sum of 5 with a positive number on the second die.\n\nWe found 4 such pairs. These are our **favorable outcomes**.\n\n**Step 1.3: Calculate the probability of getting a sum of 5.**\nProbability is defined as the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. This is the core idea of **Classical Probability**.\n\nP(sum=5) = (Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Outcomes) = 4 / 36 = 1/9.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a sum of 5 with one pair of dice is indeed 1/9. Great job on the first part!\n\n### Part 2: Probability of getting a sum of 5 at least twice when a pair of dice is tossed N times\n\nNow, things get a bit more interesting! We're repeating the dice roll N times, and we want to know the probability of our 'success' (getting a sum of 5) happening at least twice.\n\n**Step 2.1: Identify the probability of success (p).**\nFrom Part 1, we know that the probability of getting a sum of 5 in a *single* toss is 1/9. We'll call this 'p', our probability of success for one trial. So, p = 1/9.\n\n**Step 2.2: Identify the probability of failure (q).**\nIf getting a sum of 5 is a 'success', then *not* getting a sum of 5 is a 'failure'. Since there are only two possibilities (success or failure) for each toss, their probabilities must add up to 1. So, q = 1 - p = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.\n\n**Step 2.3: Recognize that this is a binomial probability problem.**\nWhy binomial? Because this scenario perfectly fits the conditions for a **Binomial Distribution**:\n1.  **Fixed number of trials:** We're tossing the dice N times.\n2.  **Each trial is independent:** One toss doesn't affect the next.\n3.  **Only two outcomes per trial:** Success (sum of 5) or Failure (not a sum of 5).\n4.  **Probability of success (p) is constant:** It's always 1/9 for each toss.\n\nWe're interested in the number of successes, let's call it X. So, X follows a Binomial Distribution B(N, p).\nThe general formula for binomial probability, P(X=k), which means getting exactly 'k' successes in 'N' trials, is: P(X=k) = C(N, k) * p^k * q^(N-k), where C(N, k) is the number of ways to choose k successes from N trials (also written as 'N choose k').\n\n**Step 2.4: The problem asks for P(X >= 2).**\n'At least twice' means we want the probability of getting a sum of 5 two times, or three times, or four times, all the way up to N times. Calculating P(X=2) + P(X=3) + ... + P(X=N) would be a lot of work!\n\n**Step 2.5: Use the complement rule to calculate P(X >= 2).**\nThis is a clever shortcut! The **Complement Rule** states that P(Event) = 1 - P(Not Event). In our case, 'not getting at least two successes' means getting *fewer than two successes*. The only ways to get fewer than two successes are getting exactly zero successes (X=0) or exactly one success (X=1).\nSo, P(X >= 2) = 1 - [P(X=0) + P(X=1)]. This is much easier to calculate!\n\n**Step 2.6: Calculate P(X=0) using the binomial probability formula.**\nHere, k=0 (zero successes).\nP(X=0) = C(N, 0) * p^0 * q^(N-0)\n*   C(N, 0) = 1 (There's only one way to choose 0 items from N items \u2013 choose none!)\n*   p^0 = (1/9)^0 = 1 (Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1)\n*   q^(N-0) = (8/9)^N\nSo, P(X=0) = 1 * 1 * (8/9)^N = (8/9)^N.\n\n**Step 2.7: Calculate P(X=1) using the binomial probability formula.**\nHere, k=1 (one success).\nP(X=1) = C(N, 1) * p^1 * q^(N-1)\n*   C(N, 1) = N (There are N ways to choose 1 item from N items)\n*   p^1 = (1/9)^1 = 1/9\n*   q^(N-1) = (8/9)^(N-1)\nSo, P(X=1) = N * (1/9) * (8/9)^(N-1) = (N/9) * (8/9)^(N-1).\n\n**Step 2.8: Substitute P(X=0) and P(X=1) back into the complement rule expression.**\nP(X >= 2) = 1 - [ (8/9)^N + (N/9) * (8/9)^(N-1) ]\n\n**Step 2.9: Simplify the expression.**\nThis step is all about algebraic manipulation to make the expression cleaner. Notice that both terms inside the bracket have (8/9) raised to a power. We can factor out the common term (8/9)^(N-1).\n\nLet's rewrite (8/9)^N as (8/9) * (8/9)^(N-1).\n\nP(X >= 2) = 1 - [ (8/9) * (8/9)^(N-1) + (N/9) * (8/9)^(N-1) ]\nNow, factor out (8/9)^(N-1):\nP(X >= 2) = 1 - (8/9)^(N-1) * (8/9 + N/9)\n\n**Step 2.10: Further simplify the expression.**\nCombine the terms inside the parenthesis:\n(8/9 + N/9) = (8 + N) / 9\n\nSo, P(X >= 2) = 1 - (8/9)^(N-1) * ((8 + N)/9)\n\nThis can also be written as: 1 - (N+8)/9 * (8/9)^(N-1).\n\nAnd that's our final answer!

Let's break down how to solve this quadratic equation step-by-step. Don't worry, we'll make sure you understand the 'why' behind everything!\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Equation's Identity**\nOur equation is `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0`. The very first thing we do is recognize what kind of equation we're dealing with. This is a **quadratic equation** because the highest power of 'x' is 2. The standard form for any quadratic equation is `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants.\n\n*   **Why is this important?** Identifying the type of equation helps us choose the right tools and methods to solve it. For quadratics, we have specific techniques like factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square.\n*   **In our case:** By comparing `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0` with `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, we can clearly see that `a = 1` (the coefficient of x^2), `b = 5` (the coefficient of x), and `c = 6` (the constant term).\n\n**Step 2 & 3: What about SymPy? (And why we focus on manual methods for JEE)**\nThe solution mentions using SymPy's `solve` function. SymPy is a fantastic Python library for symbolic mathematics, and it can indeed solve equations like this very quickly! It's a great tool for checking answers or for complex computations.\n\n*   **Why this is mentioned (and why we'll move on):** While computers can solve these, for your JEE exams, you need to understand and apply the *mathematical methods* yourself. The goal here is to learn *how* to solve it, not just to get an answer from a program. So, let's focus on the manual methods that you'll use in your tests.\n\n**Step 4: The Factoring Method (Our Go-To Strategy Here!)**\nThis is where the real learning happens! The factoring method is often the quickest way to solve quadratic equations, especially when the numbers are friendly (like in this problem).\n\n*   **The Big Idea:** We want to rewrite the quadratic expression `x^2 + 5x + 6` as a product of two linear factors, like `(x + p)(x + q)`. If this product equals zero, then one of the factors *must* be zero. This is called the **Zero Product Property**.\n\n*   **How to Factor:** For a quadratic `x^2 + bx + c = 0` (where `a=1`), we look for two numbers that:\n    1.  **Multiply** to give the constant term `c` (which is 6 in our case).\n    2.  **Add** to give the coefficient of the middle term `b` (which is 5 in our case).\n\n*   **Finding the Numbers:** Let's list pairs of numbers that multiply to 6:\n    *   1 and 6 (add to 7 - not 5)\n    *   -1 and -6 (add to -7 - not 5)\n    *   2 and 3 (add to 5 - **Bingo! These are our numbers!**)\n    *   -2 and -3 (add to -5 - not 5)\n\n*   **Forming the Factors:** Since our numbers are 2 and 3, we can rewrite the equation in factored form:\n    `(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0`\n\n*   **Applying the Zero Product Property:** Now that we have two factors multiplying to zero, we know that either the first factor is zero OR the second factor is zero:\n    *   `x + 2 = 0`  =>  `x = -2`\n    *   `x + 3 = 0`  =>  `x = -3`\n\n*   **Verification:** This step confirms that the roots we found are correct. It's like double-checking your work, which is always a good habit!\n\n**Final Answer:** So, the solutions (or roots) for the equation `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0` are `x = -2` or `x = -3`.
